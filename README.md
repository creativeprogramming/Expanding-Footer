Expanding-Footer
================

During this tutorial we’re going to build an expanding footer; a user interface pattern which allows the user to click on expandable footer regions if they wish to see more content. The end result is comparable to the accordion effect sometimes applied to lists and you can find it used on sites such as seesparkbox.com.
Additionally, we’re going to be using Emmet to help us write our HTML at lightning speed.
